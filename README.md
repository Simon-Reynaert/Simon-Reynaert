- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Simon-Reynaert, PhD in Biology and a nature lover that's deeply concerned about the deteriorating ecological and climatological conditions on our planet.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Biodiversity and Ecology in a broad sense, specialized in interactions between people and nature. My previous research has focused on human-wildlife dynamics, bat diversity, climate change - biodiversity interactions (both plants and soil) as well as climate change mitigation solutions for farmers. For a full list of my scientific contributions see: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4690-0955 .
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently investigating if data from different internet platforms can systematically improve monitoring of invasive species dynamics across Europe (e.g., detection of expansions into new countries).
